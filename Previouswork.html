<img src="Images/Trent.png" alt="Trenton Population Density" Class="responsive" />
<p> This map shows an example of a Population Density Map created for the area of Trenton, Ontario. Trenton is an area located North West of the City of Toronto. 
    It is part of the Municipality of Quinte West and has a population of approximately 22,000. Within this work, the population density is shown with a purple colour ramp.
    The more densly populated regions have a darker purple assigned to them. The colours proceed to be lighter as there is less population present in these areas. </p>

<img src="Images/JKTF4.PNG" alt="Okanagan" Class="responsive" />
<p> This map is a topographic map of Okanagan, British Columbia. In this work, the areas built up areas, contours, forested areas and water systems are shown to depict 
    a generalized map. This work follows a traditional colour scheme in order to show elements within the map. Green will typiclalyrepresent the forested areas, brown shows the contours,
    the lighter pink shows the built up areas, and blue represents the water bodies. A good generelization of what the area contains can therefore be seen within the map frame. </p>

<img src="Images/Image - HEATMAP.png" alt="Heat Map Image" Class="responsive" />
<p> This map shows a Heat map that was created to analyze the amount of pedestrians involved in car crashes near school areas in the years 2011-2018 for Toronto, Ontario. The 
    areas shown in a red and yellow colour signify areas with high collision rates. After further analysis, it was determined that as more speed signs were added near school areas, the number of collisions
    was generally reduced significantly. </p>

<img src="Images/FalseColourComposite_AbbyLeavens.png" alt="Remote Sensing Image" Class="responsive" />
<p> This map is a False Colour Composite that was created to analyze the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in further depth for an area near Lindsay Ontario. The areas that have a 
    darker red colour shown in the map have higher rates of vegetation (Higher Reflectance) whereas the areas with lighter red colours have more sparse vegetation patterns (Less Reflectance).  </p>
